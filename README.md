Smart Trolley Using RFID

●	The Purpose was to develop a Smart Trolley System using RFID Technology to automate tracking of items within the trolley and display relevant information on LCD Screen.

●	Integrated RFID Technology with an ARM7 based LPC2129 microcontroller to develop a smart trolley system.

●	Implemented automated tracking and monitoring of items within the trolley using RFID tags and display relevant information on LCD Screen.

●	Utilized UART Protocol for serial communication between the microcontroller (LPC2129) and Peripheral Devices, ensuring efficient data exchange and system functionality.
